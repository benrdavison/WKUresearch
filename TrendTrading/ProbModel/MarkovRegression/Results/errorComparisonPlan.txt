Comparing daily vs weekly vs monthly ema forecasts

-Use constant parameters for each (0.5, 0.3, 0.15, 0.05)

Daily:
Use standard procedures to forecast next day and calculate SSR between predicted value and actual value

Weekly (Monthly):
Convert every 5 (25) days of data into 1 point using EMA, forecast using procedures then compare actual next week EMA to forecasted (SSR)

Each time divide SSR by number of data points to have constant error value and compare errors
